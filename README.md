## My process

This time I decided to use CSS Grid which changes the approach of how I did the challenge, first I set the grid for mobile view and make sure that everything was set up accordingly what I need then, I set use the same grid from mobile view but I redistributed the cards in order to match two columns for tablet view(this is somethnig I decided since there are no indications about how tablet view) last but no least I set the grid for desktop view. Once all of this was done finally, I change the color, fonts and font-sizes so it matches the design given.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS Grid in order to do responsive layouts that are adaptive in order to distibute the content depending on the width of the screen and where I need to set the different elements.

### Continued development

I'll keep focusing on CSS Grid since I feel is a very powerful resource and bring together CSS Flexbox, Grid and Position in order to organize the layout in the best way possible according to the needs.

### Useful resources
